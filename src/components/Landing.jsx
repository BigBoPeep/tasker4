              Workspaces{" "}
            </span>
            are the top-level way to organize your work. Each Workspace
            represents a distinct area of your life or work — somewhere that has
            its own self-contained set of goals. A Workspace could be a
            location, a client, a vehicle, a hobby, or anything else that groups
            related work together.

              Projects{" "}
            </span>
            live inside a Workspace and represent a specific goal or body of
            work within it. A Project has a title, description, and deadline to
            keep you focused. Inside your Home workspace you might have projects
            like 'Repaint the Kitchen' or 'Fix the Fence'. Inside a client
            workspace, a Project might be a specific deliverable or contract
            milestone.

              Tasks{" "}
            </span>
            are the individual steps that make up a Project. They're the
            actionable items — the things you actually sit down and do. Breaking
            a Project into Tasks makes large goals feel manageable and gives you
            a clear picture of your progress. A Task can have a deadline of its
            own, so nothing slips through the cracks.
